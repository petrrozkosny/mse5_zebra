# Introduction to Power Query

## What is Power Query?

Power Query is a data connection and transformation tool built into Microsoft Excel and Power BI.  
It allows you to import, clean, reshape, and combine data from various sources without needing to write code.  
Power Query uses a visual, step-by-step interface and its own language called **M language** behind the scenes.

**Key features:**
- Connect to multiple data sources (Excel, SQL, web pages, APIs, etc.)
- Transform and clean data easily (filtering, merging, pivoting)
- Automate repetitive data preparation tasks
- Save time and reduce manual errors

## When to Use Power Query

You should use Power Query when:
- You need to clean messy data (remove duplicates, fill missing values, split columns, etc.)
- You want to automate importing and preparing data for reports
- You have to combine data from multiple files or sources
- You want a no-code or low-code solution for transforming data
- You need repeatable and refreshable data processes without manual intervention

## Power Query vs. VBA

| Feature              | Power Query                         | VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Ease of use**       | Easy, visual, no-code interface      | Requires coding knowledge                  |
| **Purpose**           | Data connection and transformation  | Automation of Excel tasks and workflows     |
| **Performance**       | Optimized for large data handling    | May be slower with very large data sets     |
| **Maintenance**       | Easy to update and manage steps      | Can be complex to debug and maintain        |
| **Learning curve**    | Beginner-friendly                   | Steeper learning curve                     |
| **Flexibility**       | Focused on data tasks                | Full control over Excel, more flexible      |

**Summary**:  
Use **Power Query** for anything related to **data cleaning, combining, and preparing**.  
Use **VBA** when you need to **control Excel tasks** (like creating buttons, automating sheets, complex macros).
